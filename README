The chart parser is heavily based on original code described in the following paper:

 Stuart M. Shieber, Yves Schabes and Fernando C. N. Pereira (1995)
 `Principles and Implementation of Deductive Parsing', Journal of
 Logic Programming 24(1-2):3-36

The file lefff.pl has been automatically extracted from the Lefff lexicon
(http://alpage.inria.fr/~sagot/lefff.html) which is described here.
